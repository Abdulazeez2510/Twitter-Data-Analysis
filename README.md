Using hive, the Twitter.json file is handled using GET_JSON_OBJECT UDF mechanism. Also, by processing Dictionary.txt using hive, what were the hashtags used in the file, and how many times each hashtag was used can be identified. Further, Determination of the score for each tweet that was posted, identifying whether the tweet had a positive or negative sentiment using the dictionary.txt file is done.
